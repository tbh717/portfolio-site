### Introduction, presence

Look, it's another AOTY listicle. Specifically, it's *my* personal blog's AOTY listicle for 2021, obscured by my lack of attention to SEO and possibly only reached by sharing it with people I personally know.

There's not much to introduce here, as I'll let the blurbs speak for me, and the albums for themselves. I'm not doing anything that every publication doesn't already do (typically a few weeks too early) as the end of the year draws near. The only general thing of note is that I primarily listen to my albums by streaming them on Spotify, on a variety of speakers around my home, in my car, and in public, while occasionally purchasing them on Bandcamp or vinyl to support the artist.

There was no particular over-arching theme to my year of listening in 2021 that I can really express at the start here, nor is there one I can really identify, as I tend to stick to the releases I like best and that kind of excludes me from getting comfy with the biggest albums, and the ones most pertinent to the \~\~*meta-narrative*\~\~ in modern musical culture. The only change that a dragging pandemic has induced in my listening and discovery habits compared to years past are:
<br>
1.) that I primarily do most of my listening alone, as opposed to attending a lot more shows (to cultivate my appreciation for how albums translate and transform live) and experiencing music, and
<br>
2.) that I now get a lot of recommendations from my lovely friends, and sometimes even a few strangers, across Discord servers.

**Side-note**: Unfortunately, I've fallen victim to this Gatsby template's inflexible styling system (for now), so bear with me on scrolling through a long post made even longer by some full-width album images and oversized titles.

### \#3. **Deafeaven** - *Infinte Granite*
![Invent Animate - The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was](/media/aoty-2021/idyll.jpg)
ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Shoegaze / Post-Rock** - *gauzey*, *dreamy*, *wistful*, *expansive*

Deafheaven, a once metal band, who maybe never earned their metal card, that had their metal card revoked with the pink-adorned and pop-suffused *Sunbather*, somewhat restored with the darker *New Bermuda*, revoked again with the more progressive and sprawling *Ordinary Corrupt Human Love*, and somewhat restored with their one-off blackgaze banger "Black Brick," are no stranger to loaded album releases and endless discourse. I think the fault lies somewhere between:<br>
1.) the nature of gatekeeping metal fanbases clashing with a fawning press, and
2.) Deafheaven's nature as an experimental, constantly evolving band.<br>
But thankfully we only really have the latter to worry about with this release, where they've dropped 90% of their metal schtick as George Clark replaced his signature shrieks in equal parts with clean vocals, and the band left the distortion pedals at home.

Other than that, I don't think a whole lot has changed from the Deafheaven I know and love. I expect this is going to place a lot higher in my year end's list than others, given the less-than-lukewarm reaction from my friends and folks in the press, but I also think I got into Deafheaven from a different route than many of them to begin with. In short, I came to *Sunbather* a well-versed teenage headbanger and post-rock appreciatior, who had never really explored the metal genre's more experimental, protracted subgenres that straddled the two, such as black metal. It was my comfort with screamed vocals that eased me in, but my love for expressive and expansive soundscapes that kept me around between releases. This is the band's stable core that's allowed my appreciation for them to grow over the years, culminating in *Ordinary Corrupt Human Love* finding a spot in the upper echelons of my all-time favorite albums, then shrinking back just a tad this year for a still excellent record.

Much like with *OHCL*, I find myself somewhat alone in being very taken with and trusting of the band's change of direction. However, whereas I think the discourse around the band's early days was ridiculous and wrongheaded, things have mellowed out and I certainly *understand* the diverse critiques of these past two albums. Specifically, I get why people would describe *Infinite Granite* as watered-down shoegaze with grating vocals and repetitious song structures. And I can't do much else but... simply disagree, and tout its positive aspects, to account for my appreciation of this album.

### \#3. **Adjy** - *The Idyll Opus (I-VI)*
![Invent Animate - The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was](/media/aoty-2021/idyll.jpg)
ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Progressive Folk / Emo** - *nostalgic*, *tender*, *heavenly*

There's kind of nowhere to start with this one. From my perspective, a band with very little publicly available information or social media history, that I had only ever known through one dearly beloved and technically excellent EP fusing math rock with a folky sort of emo, unexpectedly shows up in my Release Radar, while I was bussing across Seattle on vacation, with a 1.5-hour long release replete with movements within movements and a number of dense, referential song titles. I didn't really know where to start then either, opting for a blind listen while wandering through Seattle's beautiful arboretum with friends, and a more intentional listening session while flying home, where I could read the [accompanying lexiconical lyric book](https://www.theidyllopus.com/text), chock-full of *22, A Million*-esque cryptic design cues and footnotes that construct a dense narrative and metanarrative that comprise the album's lyrical content and emotional core.

I've gotta be upfront: there's something about this that rings suspiciously close to some young-adult fiction suffused, weekday evangelical worship band \~\~*energy*\~\~ here. The former plays itself out in the album's melodramatic narrative involving two lovers intertwined in some sort of cosmic, era-hopping story that's discovered and by and told via a bereaved alchemist, while the latter is apparent in the band's clean, major-key sound and and the lead vocalist's equally clean, histrionic vocal performance. Unfortunately for my taste and my pride as a 24-year old man, both of these tap deep into some long unrealized veins clearly still coursing through me (I don't read YA anymore but I sure do listen to some mawkish and yearning emo records). Both are executed with an *astonishing* attention to detail and craft. As I noticed one critic point out, only one song has any sort of repeated hook ("O Tonight")â€”meaning that the vocalist carries nearly the album's entire 1.5 hour runtime with continuously original melodies and lyrics (!!!).

This is a very specific, wholly unnecessary endeavor that can occasionally veer too close to theater-kid territory for comfort to me, but I stand in awe of the achievement. The vast majority of it evokes what I love most in the best emo, with a strong sense for the grandiose and the sublime, and marries it to an equally grandiose narrative. I think that story can sometimes get in the way, as the vocalist struggles to fit his novel's worth of lyrical content into a comparatively small handful of verses, but I still don't have quite a grasp of the album's story and can put that to the side to appreciate it solely on the album's frequently bombastic, occasionally delicate, always beautiful folk-inflected soundscapes. It's an absolutely colossal piece of work that, thankfully for my limited emotional reserves and attention span, can be whatever size as I need it to be on a given day.

### \#2. **Invent Animate** - *The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was*
![Invent Animate - The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was](/media/aoty-2021/tssaiinw.jpg)
ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Metalcore / Djent** - *dense*, *atmospheric*, *dark*, *complex*

Invent Animate's prior release, Greyview, was the sleeper hit that championed nearly all of my year-end listening stats from Spotify last year, and I was almost ashamed of it. To me, metalcore was the genre of my teenage years. Headbanging to some low-tuned 7-strings was one of the key outlets for my angst and aimlessness. I wasn't quite tapped into the genre's critical resurgence and nostalgic channeling that's made itself so clear this year, where we see other acts like SeeYouSpaceCowboy, Knocked Loose, and Dying Wish getting their due appreciation, so it felt somewhat like relenting to my old habits and abandoning more critically engaging and challenging music. Not that this stopped meâ€”as evidenced by its absolute domination of my Spotify 2020 Wrapped, it was just about the most frictionless and smooth album to run through in my car and get that subwoofer pumping on a weeknight grocery run. I could tune out the lyrics and absolutely *vibe* to some rhythmic chugging and seriously smooth textures. But, to lay my cards on the table, I felt a bit embarrassed to so completely capitulate to the genre's overwrought, self-serious lyrics (lol though, as an unashamed emo listener) and both its obviously brutal and brutally obvious breakdowns, as if I had regressed a decade in my taste.

Anyways, some serious easing of my self-image and some serious time in the gym induced my desire for *more* of this music, not less. And this is the best of the best this year. With a finally stabilized line-up, Invent Animate put out an excellent djentcore record last year, signed to the biggest and baddest label for that niche genre, and put out this release to celebrate. It's *almost* like cheating again to rank it so high on this list, as a 2-song + 1-interlude package negates the difficulty in maintaining this level of quality over 10+ songs. Yet, it's a complete package, with each song representing a respective victim in some sort of dualistic relationship plagued by one member's destructive addiction habits.

The interlude serves its part as a lovely atmospheric breather, but obviously the album shines when Invent Animate are shredding through some seriously dark, dense, and impassioned off-kilter riffs. The Sun Sleeps has an infectious chorus and a great sense of momentum throughout the song, whereas As If It Never Was is replete with glacial, towering post-metallic walls of sound and an absolutely *fucking righteous* bridge. Its by far the sharpest songwriting I've heard these guys put out, enhanced by hefty production, harrowing unclean vocal sections, and desperate cleanly sung choruses.

I can't say enough good about these tracks. It's the clearest-eyed these guys have been in their career. I think Invent Animate is on the verge of mastering their grip on the sound and themes they've been going for from the start, and I can't wait to hear this followed up on the next full-length. The [haunting, EP-spanning music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHHyRdVa4Xo) does a lot of work to express this as well. Anyone remotely metalcore-curious should give this 10 minutes of their time.

### \#1. **Porter Robinson** - *Nurture*
![Porter Robinson - Nurture](/media/aoty-2021/shelter.jpg)
ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Synth Pop / EDM** - *uplifting*, *beautiful*, *introspective*, *catchy*

It's hard to separate the monumental release of this album from Porter's 7-year musical writer's block, and the pent-up expectations of the EDM scene that shadowed it. It's even hard to separate the music from this contextâ€”the lyrics burgeon with the weight of unmet expectations, of viscous self-doubt and critique, and the glory of eventual creative triumph. Hell, one of the album's singles is called "Musician."

Yet, I arrived to the album's slow drip of singles nearly a year prior to its release without any of that context. I had flirted with Worlds in high school, notably throwing "Sad Machine" on a few of my places and rocking out to its CHVRCHES' feature. It is well outside my indie wheelhouse, in a world I'll never fully be able to appreciate given my self-induced exclusion from both the side of his fanbase drawn in by the promise of neon visuals and sick beats, as well as the side drawn in by his persistent borrowing from animeâ€”both of which get something key to Porter's aesthetic: it's incredibly fun for the former, and incredibly expressive and touching for the latter.

It seems that all I needed was to hear his trademark aesthetic presented in something more akin to singer-songwriter form, with charismatic vocals upfront and more traditional verse-chorus-verse song structures. In those songs, I found an unusually open and expressive artist grappling with the burden of expectations in ways clearly defined by his years-long writer's block, but also packaged up in a way that straddles the happy-sad lyrical divide with an uncommon clarity. I found a suite of songs that mash up some of the most unabashedly gorgeous textures and sounds in electronic music with compelling song structures and massive hooks. The drive of EDM is still there, with all of the catchiness, replayability, and emotional depth that more traditional songwriting structures allow.

As I alluded to in the introduction to this, Porter's creds among the show-going EDM crowd are unmistakable, and this is in part because his live experience is stunning, and completely realizes the album. While the singles on this album are clearly its emotional core and comprise its most compelling suite of tracks, every other more sketch-like track was given equal weight on the stage, with every track being interspliced, borrowed from, and reshaped into something new. Although it had firmly staked its place as an all-time favorite, and the most important album to me this year, hearing these tracks live illuminated a side of this album that reveals its mastery and potency. With more time and more shows outside the album cycle, I think just about all of these songs have the potential to claim classics status in the electronic genre.
