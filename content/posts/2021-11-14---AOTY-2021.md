### Introduction, presence

Look, it's another AOTY listicle. Specifically, it's *my* personal blog's AOTY listicle for 2021, obscured by my lack of attention to SEO and possibly only reached by sharing it with people I personally know.

There's not much to introduce here, as I'll let the blurbs speak for me, and the albums for themselves. I'm not doing anything that every publication doesn't already do (typically a few weeks too early) as the end of the year draws near. The only general thing of note is that I primarily listen to my albums by streaming them on Spotify, on a variety of speakers around my home, in my car, and in public, while occasionally purchasing them on Bandcamp or vinyl to support the artist.

There was no particular over-arching theme to my year of listening in 2021 that I can really express at the start here, nor is there one I can really identify, as I tend to stick to the releases I like best and that kind of excludes me from getting comfy with the biggest albums, and the ones most pertinent to the \~\~*meta-narrative*\~\~ in modern musical culture. The only change that a dragging pandemic has induced in my listening and discovery habits compared to years past are:
<br>
1.) that I primarily do most of my listening alone, as opposed to attending a lot more shows (to cultivate my appreciation for how albums translate and transform live) and experiencing music, and
<br>
2.) that I now get a lot of recommendations from my lovely friends, and sometimes even a few strangers, across Discord servers.

Anyways, I'll be running down a list of my top 30 albums, with accompanying genre and mood descriptors for each. I'm writing up increasingly long blurbs for my 10 favorites, but will spare y'all my thoughts on what my 27th favorite album says about the state of discourse or whatever.

**Side-note**: Unfortunately, I've fallen victim to this Gatsby template's inflexible styling system (for now), so bear with me on scrolling through a long post made even longer by some full-width album images and oversized titles.

### \#7. **Yasmin Williams** - *Urban Driftwood*
![Yasmin Williams - Urban Driftwood](/media/aoty-2021/driftwood.jpg)

ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Acoustic Folk** - *natural*, *harmonious*, *subtle*, *serene*

This release was a delightful surprise to me. It came out of left-field from a podcast recommendation and connected with me immediately. It's one of the few releases on this list that isn't part of a scene and isn't a loaded legacy band release. It essentially arrives on its own terms, baggage free.

The distinct lack of that context makes it incredibly easy to sink back into and get lost in this record. Yasmin Williams is an incredible talent, finger-plucking heavenly passages out of an acoustic lap guitar, thumping it along the way for good measure and rhythm. Some equally understated instruments occasionally sneak into the soundscape, like the glockenspiel on "Jarabi," padding out the album's sonic diversity and giving it some extra oomph. However, Yasmin's solo guitar work is so compelling and engaging and texturally rich on its own that these additions wouldn't be necessary, although they are appreciated and allow her to flex her other musical muscles.

This is a primetime shoulder season record. I found it in the early spring, and took it with me on long, meandering runs through a beautifully shaded neighborhood in San Antonio, under sunshowers and wispy clouds. I've rediscovered it this fall, throwing it on as I putter around the home or lounge on the sofa while the crisp autumnal air and early nights descend on Dallas. It's just a lovely record to give yourself over to and get lost in.

### \#6. **Deafeaven** - *Infinte Granite*
![Deafheaven - Infinite Granite](/media/aoty-2021/granite.jpg)

ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Shoegaze / Post-Rock** - *gauzey*, *dreamy*, *wistful*, *expansive*

Deafheaven, a once metal band, who maybe never earned their metal card, that had their metal card revoked with the pink-adorned and pop-suffused *Sunbather*, somewhat restored with the darker *New Bermuda*, revoked again with the more progressive and sprawling *Ordinary Corrupt Human Love*, and somewhat restored with their one-off blackgaze banger "Black Brick," are no stranger to loaded album releases and endless discourse. I think the fault lies somewhere between:<br>
1.) the nature of gatekeeping metal fanbases clashing with a fawning press, and
2.) Deafheaven's nature as an experimental, constantly evolving band.<br>
But thankfully we only really have the latter to worry about with this release, where they've dropped 90% of their metal schtick as George Clark replaced his signature shrieks in equal parts with clean vocals, and the band left the distortion pedals at home.

Other than that, I don't think a whole lot has changed from the Deafheaven I know and love. I expect this is going to place a lot higher in my year end list than others, given the less-than-lukewarm reaction from my friends and folks in the press, but I also think I got into Deafheaven from a different route than many of them to begin with. In short, I came to *Sunbather* a well-versed teenage headbanger and post-rock appreciatior, who had never really explored the metal genre's more experimental, protracted subgenres that straddled the two, such as black metal. It was my comfort with screamed vocals that eased me in, but my love for expressive and expansive soundscapes that kept me around between releases. This is the band's stable core that's allowed my appreciation for them to grow over the years, culminating in my adoration for *Ordinary Corrupt Human Love*.

Much like with *OHCL*, I find myself somewhat alone in trusting and enjoying the band's change of direction. However, whereas I think the discourse around the band's early releases was ridiculous and wrongheaded, things have mellowed out and I certainly *understand* the diverse critiques of these past two albums. Specifically, I get why people would describe *Infinite Granite* as watered-down shoegaze with grating vocals and repetitious song structures. And I can't do much else but simply disagree, and tout its positive aspects, to account for my appreciation of this album.

The sweeping, chord-based dual guitar work here is roughly the same kind as what we saw on previous releases, such as the endings of "Honeycomb" and "Gifts for the Earth," just without the juxtaposition against chainsaw-like black metal shredding. The drums are given even more time to shine, snaking around the movements and exploding into creative fills, just without black metal blast beats. George's vocals are clean now, but still yearning and evocative, with searching, poetic lyrics to match. The songs are long and often repetitive before breaking into unique and cathartic endings (much like, uh, most black metal). They're still clearly top-notch Deafheaven songs, just comprising more cinematic textures than ever before. I find this to be a much better written, better produced, better sounding, and more emotionally charged release than most modern shoegaze, because that's what Deafheaven does best.

### \#5. **Dreamwell** - *Modern Grotesque*
![Dreamwell - Modern Grotesque](/media/aoty-2021/grotesque.jpg)

ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Post-Hardcore / Screamo** - *poetic*, *strained*, *cosmic*, *chaotic*

Screamo is probably my all around favorite genre at this time, and the one whose continued potential and output excites the most. As evidenced by its absence in my year-end list, I wasn't moved by many of its releases this year. I found the the scr(eams) from this year's excellent sampling of throwback melodic metalcore, and the emo in its the more boundary-pushing 5th wave acts this year. But Dreamwell's *Modern Grotesque* was this year's shining star: a record that I discovered and bounced off early, but found myself gravitating toward more and more as the months passed.

It's hard to give a proper account of what makes this album compelling, because it truly is a sum of its many well-oiled and intentionally executed parts. As a longtime post-hardcore fan, the propulsive drums, winding bass, and angular guitars made me feel right at home. The production is unusually crisp and (dare I say) *modern*, which helps a record that could easily feel at home in 2005 instead feel much fresher, energized, and new.

The vocals swell into pained howls and sink in equal parts to spoken word verses. There's less of a clear delineation here than other post-hardcore and bands, instead amping up and down as the songs evolve dynamically. It makes for song structures that feel more post-rock than hardcore, and occasionally enable the songs to blow up into stunning climaxes, such as the album's titular track. But whereas post-rock albums often define their protracted lulls with their rewarding climaxes, every moment of this album feels necessary and compelling. The album takes a more melodic turn in its middle stretch, but offers the listener its most intimate and personally revealing songs.

Still, I think the album is at its best when its intentionally dense and hugeâ€”when the vocalist is taking the grotesque's literary roots seriously and crafting us portraits of the strange and the eerie, when the guitars cascade into high-strung tremolos, and when it spirals manically into five alarm fire breakdowns. For as far as the album strays into abstract and remote imagery, it always supports its lyrical content with a clear sense of urgency and momentum. It's draws influence in equal measure from more emotionally raw modern hardcore groups like Pianos Become the Teeth and TouchÃ© AmorÃ©, and legacy acts in the vein of Converge and City of Caterpillar.

This album has a specific audience, and you'll know whether you're a member as soon as the intro track bleeds into "Painting Myself a Darker Day." To return to my earlier notion that this album is more than the sum of its parts, I think the technical precision and obvious influences on display here can hide how accomplished a record this is, and how rare a feat that is in the DIY scene. I really let the album wash over me during my first few listens because there were no loose threads or snagged ends to catch my attention. All it took was for me to set aside 40 minutes, sit down with it intentionally, and look straight into its bloodshot eyes to find a modern classic.

***Key Tracks***: Painting Myself a Darker Day, You Dreamt of Me I Dreamt of a Mountain of Salt, Modern Grotesque

### \#4. **Adjy** - *The Idyll Opus (I-VI)*
![Adjy - The Idyll Opus (I-VI)](/media/aoty-2021/idyll.jpg)

ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Progressive Folk / Emo** - *magical*, *tender*, *wistful*, *intricate*

There's kind of nowhere to start with this one. From my listener's perspective: a band with very little in the way of publicity or social media, that I had only ever known through one dearly beloved EP which fused math rock and folky emo, unexpectedly shows up in my Release Radar while I was bussing across Seattle on vacation, with a 1.5-hour long epic release steeped in old Appalachian history and an equally folky sensibility, replete with nested movements and written within an entirely complete and self-referential lore. I didn't really know where to start then either, opting for a blind and private listen on my AirPods while wandering through Seattle's beautiful arboretum behind friends, and a more intentional listening session while flying home, where I read the [accompanying lexiconical lyric book](https://www.theidyllopus.com/text), chock-full of *22, A Million*-esque cryptic design cues and footnotes that construct a dense narrative and meta-narrative comprising the album's lyrical content and emotional core.

Before I dig deeper, I've gotta be upfront: there's something about this that rings suspiciously close to some young-adult fiction inflected, weekday evangelical church service worship band \~\~*energy*\~\~ here. The former plays itself out in the album's melodramatic narrative involving two lovers intertwined in some sort of cosmic, era-hopping story that's discovered and by and told via a bereaved alchemist, while the latter is obvious in the band's clean, major-key instrumental pieces and and the lead vocalist's equally clean, histrionic vocal performance. Unfortunately for my taste and my pride as a 24-year old man, both of these tap deep into some long neglected veins clearly still coursing through me (I don't read YA anymore but I sure do listen to some equivalently mawkish and yearning emo records). At the same time, grandiose stories about chance love and adventure are timeless, and Adjy delivers that story about as earnestly and clear-eyed as they could hope to.

More importantly, the album executed with an *astonishing* attention to detail and craft. As I noticed one online critic point out, only one song makes use of any sort of repeated hook ("O Tonight")â€”meaning that the vocalist carries nearly the album's *entire 1.5 hour runtime* with continuously novel melodies and lyrics (!!!). In "Where June Meets July: III," a gorgeous dulcimer (in keeping with the album's uniquely Appalachian influences) breaks into the song right after the prior verse sets the stage for some sort of Midwestern dance. It's one of the most stunning musical moments this year, yet the album is chock-full of other endearing surprises. The vocals are abundant in the band's attempt to fit a novelworthy story into the more limited medium of an album, and as such, they often lead the music forward as it weaves between moods and motifs to fit the story at hand. Even if it's clear that this is the vocalist's passion project, the band plays in full synergy, delivering a rousing and affecting performance.

This is a very unique, wholly unnecessary endeavor that can occasionally veer too close to "theater kid writes a musical in their summer cabin" territory for comfort to me, but I stand in awe of the achievement. The vast majority of it evokes what I love most in the best emo, with a strong sense for the grandiose and the sublime, and marries it to an fittingly grandiose narrative. As my musical interests angle much more toward a work's sound than its lyrics, I find that the story here can sometimes get in the way, as the vocalist struggles to fit his novel's worth of lyrical content into a comparatively small handful of verses. But it's truly good enough that I can put that to the side to appreciate it solely on its frequently bombastic, occasionally delicate, always beautiful folk-inflected soundscapes. It's an absolutely colossal piece of work that, in accordance with my limited emotional reserves and attention span, can be whatever size as I need it to be on a given day.

***Key Tracks***: In Media Res (Between Longing and Mystery), Where June Meets July: III. at a Dance Where The Stars Cross, Eve Beneath the Maple Tree

### \#3. **dltzk** - *Frailty*
![dltzk - Frailty](/media/aoty-2021/frailty.jpg)

ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Glitch Pop / Hyperpop** - *playful*, *anxious*, *youthful*, *noisy*

Fuck man, this album positively bowled me over! In the last possible month, in the most unexpected genre. I really have been out of the loop when it comes to hyperpop: landing somewhere between absolutely getting down with some 100 gecs when I'm surrounded by enthused friends, and absolutely never being in the mood to dig into the genre alone. I've always *gotten* it to some extent, but more often than not, the millennial-leaning tendencies of my "tweener" generational classification beat out the terminally online, Gen Z ones.

But it helps that this album isn't exactly hyper. It feels more like a bedroom pop record, with some very DIY emo sensibilitiesâ€”filtered through a very glitchy, often noisy, and occasionally rambunctious electronic instrumental palette. There's a large selection here of *proper* 3+ minute-long songs, with varying and experimental structures, from ballads to anthems to depressive rockers. But if its the more traditional structure that drew me in, its ultimately that hyperpop palette that brings the album to life. It's wide in its emotional range: manic, anxious, crushed, and the music expands to match.

I made the emo comparison earlier because, to both its staunchest defenders and detractors, it's a genre that confronts emotion in an almost comically direct fashion at times. Vocalists often belt out simple and incredibly charged proclamations of grief, longing, and melancholy. dltzk does a similar thing here, maybe fashioning himself after the genre, or at least speaking as straightforwardly as one might expect an anxious teenager to pen in a confessional text. There's no bullshitting here, and it makes the record emotionally efficacious and honest. His feeling of melancholy is captured in the album's subdued, singer-songwriter lows, in songs like "pretender," while mania and nostalgia explode into breakcor at the end of "misplace," or in the middle of "kodak moment."

The textures that the album curates are really choice as well, from bouncy and playful synths to maudlin, Undertale-esque piano melodies. The way it draws from 90's and 2000's video game soundtracks in these sounds really suffuses the album with a heaping helping of nostalgia and wistfulness, for those (like myself) who might find themselves equally suffused with those cultural artifacts. Frailty is a true product of its time, generation, and media references, so I'm still unsure how well this sound may age. But it's the most potent example I've found of what this genre can offer. It's a staunch reminder that artists don't simply need to hawk the same old lost decades to evoke the same, timeless yearning feelings (ahem, **Silk Sonic**), as there are still entirely new soundscapes still to imagine.

***Key Tracks***: pretender, search party, kodak moment, champ

### \#2. **Invent Animate** - *The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was*
![Invent Animate - The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was](/media/aoty-2021/tssaiinw.jpg)

ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Metalcore / Djent** - *dense*, *atmospheric*, *dark*, *complex*

Invent Animate's prior release, Greyview, was the sleeper hit that championed nearly all of my year-end listening stats from Spotify last year, and I was almost ashamed of it. To me, metalcore was the genre of my teenage years. Headbanging to some low-tuned 7-strings was one of the key outlets for my angst and aimlessness. I wasn't quite tapped into the genre's critical resurgence and nostalgic channeling that's made itself so clear this year, where we see other acts like SeeYouSpaceCowboy, Knocked Loose, and Dying Wish getting their due appreciation, so it felt somewhat like relenting to my old habits and abandoning more critically engaging and challenging music. Not that this stopped meâ€”as evidenced by its absolute domination of my Spotify 2020 Wrapped, it was just about the most frictionless and smooth album to run through in my car and get that subwoofer pumping on a weeknight grocery run. I could tune out the lyrics and absolutely *vibe* to some rhythmic chugging and seriously smooth textures. But, to lay my cards on the table, I felt a bit embarrassed to so completely capitulate to the genre's overwrought, self-serious lyrics (lol though, as an unashamed emo listener) and both its obviously brutal and brutally obvious breakdowns, as if I had regressed a decade in my taste.

Anyways, some serious easing of my self-image and some serious time in the gym induced my desire for *more* of this music, not less. And this is the best of the best this year. With a finally stabilized line-up, Invent Animate put out an excellent djentcore record last year, signed to the biggest and baddest label for that niche genre, and put out this release to celebrate. It's *almost* like cheating again to rank it so high on this list, as a 2-song + 1-interlude package negates the difficulty in maintaining this level of quality over 10+ songs. Yet, it's a complete package, with each song representing a respective victim in some sort of dualistic relationship plagued by one member's destructive addiction habits.

The interlude serves its part as a lovely atmospheric breather, but obviously the album shines when Invent Animate are shredding through some seriously dark, dense, and impassioned off-kilter riffs. The Sun Sleeps has an infectious chorus and a great sense of momentum throughout the song, whereas As If It Never Was is replete with glacial, towering post-metallic walls of sound and an absolutely *fucking righteous* bridge. Its by far the sharpest songwriting I've heard these guys put out, enhanced by hefty production, harrowing unclean vocal sections, and desperate cleanly sung choruses.

I can't say enough good about these tracks. It's the clearest-eyed these guys have been in their career. I think Invent Animate is on the verge of mastering their grip on the sound and themes they've been going for from the start, and I can't wait to hear this followed up on the next full-length. The [haunting, EP-spanning music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHHyRdVa4Xo) does a lot of work to express this as well. Anyone remotely metalcore-curious should give this 10 minutes of their time.

### \#1. **Porter Robinson** - *Nurture*
![Porter Robinson - Nurture](/media/aoty-2021/shelter.jpg)

ðŸŽ§ðŸ‘‰ **Synth Pop / EDM** - *uplifting*, *beautiful*, *introspective*, *catchy*

It's hard to separate the monumental release of this album from Porter's 7-year musical writer's block, and the pent-up expectations of the EDM scene that shadowed it. It's even hard to separate the music from this contextâ€”the lyrics burgeon with the weight of unmet expectations, of viscous self-doubt and critique, and the glory of eventual creative triumph. Hell, one of the album's singles is called "Musician."

Yet, I arrived to the album's slow drip of singles nearly a year prior to its release without any of that context. I had flirted with *Worlds* in high school, notably throwing "Sad Machine" on a few of my places and rocking out to its indie crossover features. It is well outside my usual wheelhouse, in a world I'll never fully be able to appreciate given my self-induced exclusion from both the side of his fanbase drawn in by the promise of neon visuals and sick beats, as well as the side drawn in by his persistent borrowing from anime. Importantly, both of these get something key to Porter's aesthetic: he makes incredibly lively and danceable music for the former, and incredibly expressive and sincere music for the latter.

It seems that all I needed was to hear his trademark aesthetic presented in something more akin to singer-songwriter form, with charismatic vocals upfront and more traditional verse-chorus-verse song structures. In those songs, I found an unusually open and honest artist grappling with the burden of expectations in ways clearly defined by his years-long writer's block, packaged up in a way that straddles the happy-sad lyrical divide with an unusual clarity. I found a suite of songs that combine some of the most unabashedly gorgeous textures and sounds I've ever heard in the electronic genre with compelling song structures and massive hooks. The celebratory drive of EDM is still there, with all of the catchiness, replayability, and emotional depth that more traditional songwriting structures allow.

As I alluded to in the introduction to this, Porter's creds among the show-going EDM crowd are unmistakable, and this is in part because his live experience is stunningâ€”a critical part of his musicianship that completely realizes the potential of his songs. While the singles on this album are clearly its emotional core and comprise its most fleshed out suite of tracks, every other more sketch-like track was given equal weight on the stage, with every track being spliced together, borrowed from in other tracks, and reshaped into something new. Although it had firmly staked its place as an all-time favorite and the most important album to me this year, hearing these tracks live illuminated a side of this album that reveals its mastery and potency. With more time and more shows outside the album cycle, I think just about all of these songs have the potential to claim classics status in the electronic genre.
