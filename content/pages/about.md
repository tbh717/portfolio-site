I'm **Tyler**—one of many.

This one in particular is a recent **San Antonio** → **Dallas** transplant, who currently works remotely as a **Software Engineer** for **USAA**.

I have a few years of **full stack development** experience under my brass buckled belt—building everything from reactive enterprise microservices capable of handling tens of millions of hourly API calls, to boutique admin console websites, to 4X turn-based strategy games. I love learning the best new tools to build a product, but I'll harp the loudest on the joys of functional programming and sound technical documentation practices when it comes down to it.

While I don't get to flex these muscles as regularly, I also have experience as a self-taught **graphic designer**, having spent a few years managing the visual identity of a student-run university newspaper and occasionally busting my chops for technical documentation and hackathons.

In my free time, I love to cook (ask me about the recipe catalogs of Yotam Ottolenghi or Fuschia Dunlop), explore everything from local coffee roasters to distant national parks, and pair the **[hottest fifth-wave emo LPs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O5CoajpOGI)** with equally hot, sun-drenched runs.
